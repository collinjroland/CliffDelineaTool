# CliffDelineaTool
<em>CliffDelineaTool</em> is a tool to map coastal cliffs by finding cliff base and top positions from topographic data.</br>
It assumes that if a coast is described by a series of coastline-normal transects, a cliff base and a cliff top position can be identified for individual transects based on elevation, across-shore location and the relationship with other points along the transects.</br></br>
The MATLAB script takes as input a text file with a series of points conrtaining the following information:
- point ID
- transect ID 
- elevation
- distance from the seaward end of the transect
